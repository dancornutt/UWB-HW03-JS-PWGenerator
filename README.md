# Secret Password Generator Site
This project was centered around using javascript on an already existing website. The html and css files were not changed, only a javascript file was added to the site.

The site should be used to generate a random password which can be used on other sites or applications. Passwords are required to be between 8 and 128 inclusive. The possible password characters can be lowercase letters, uppercase letter, numbers and/or special characters. If the user does not select any options the script exits.

Once the questions are answered by the user, the program displays the new random password in the output window. This can then be copied and used by the user.

## Getting Started

Luckily this is a static site so there isn't much set-up to do. You should have a decent understanding of javascript if you want to understand how the passwords are calculated. The deployed site is found at: [Password Generator](https://dancornutt.github.io/UWB-HW03-JS-PWGenerator/)
