# Secret Password Generator Site
This project is centered on creating a mobile first, responsive website. The basis was utilizing Bootsrap's grid system and components. After basic structure was met, the styling needed to loosely match the pictures in the following screen widths: 400px, 768px, and 992px.

## Getting Started

Luckily this is a static site so there isn't much set-up to do. You should have a decent understanding of html and css. Knowing Bootstrap would be very helpful.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have a good text editor or IDE for making edits to the code. For this project VS Code was used and was very useful.
Below are the tools used for this site:
    * Text Editor
    * Git
    * Github account
    * Browser (Chrome was used for development)

### Installing

These are the installation steps to get the site up and running:

    * Log into Github
    * Fork this repo
    * Clone your Forked repo on your local machine
    * Navigate to the index.html file and open it in your favorite browser

## Running the tests

No tests were constructed, in the future there will be custom javascript but at this time there is none.

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
